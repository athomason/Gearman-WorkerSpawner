=head1 NAME

Gearman::WorkerSpawner - Subprocess manager for Gearman workers in a
Danga::Socket environment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # write client code in some Danga::Socket environment, e.g. Perlbal:

    my $worker_manager = Gearman::WorkerSpawner->new;

    # add one or more workers
    $worker_manager->add_worker(
        class        => 'AdditionWorker',
        num_workers  => 4,
        config       => {
            left_hand => 3,
        },
    );
    $worker_manager->run_method(adder => { right_hand => 3 }, sub {
        my $return = shift;
        print $return->{sum};
    });
    Danga::Socket->EventLoop;

    # and in the worker:

    package MethodWorker;
    use base 'Gearman::WorkerSpawner::BaseWorker';

    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my $self = bless Gearman::WorkerSpawner::BaseWorker->new(@_), $class;
        $self->register_method(adder => \&add);
        return $self;
    }

    sub add {
        my MethodWorker $self = shift;
        my $args = shift;
        return { sum => $self->{config}{left_hand} + $args->{right_hand} };
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Launches subclasses of L<Gearman::Worker> in their own processes for
communication with a gearmand. External Gearman servers may be used, or one can
be created for the lifetime of the spawner.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item * Gearman::WorkerSpawner->new(%params)

Constructor, can take the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * gearmand

Specifies the location of the Gearman server to use. This may either be an
array reference of host:port specs ; or a comma separated list of host:port
specs; or I<auto>, which specifies that the WorkerSpawner should spawn a
separate process to contain a Gearman server. The advantage of using this over
running gearmand externally is that the Gearman server process will halt itself
in the event of the calling process' demise; the disadvantage is that you give
up gearmand redundancy. Defaults to I<auto>.

=item * check_period

Time in seconds between live-worker checks. Any zombie children are reaped with
C<waitpid> during the check, and enough workers are spawned to make the total
C<num_workers> again.

=item * perl

Path to the C<perl(1)> binary with which to execute workers. Defaults to
C<$^X>.

=item * reaper

WorkerSpawner periodically reaps any dead children of its running process. If
there are non-WorkerSpawner child processes in your program, you won't know
when they die. To be notified of such events, you can provide a subref as the
C<reaper> parameter which will be called with the PID of any reaped children
which don't belong to WorkerSpawner.

Along that line, only a single WorkerSpawner may be created in a process
(otherwise multiple spawners would race to reap each others' children, making
worker accounting impossible). As such, new() will croak if called more than
once.

=item * sigchld

If true, a SIGCHLD handler is installed which immediately schedules a child
check, rather than waiting upwards of C<check_period> seconds. Defaults to
true.

=back

=item Gearman::WorkerSpawner->gearmand_pid()

Returns the PID of the gearmand which was started up if I<auto> was given
as the C<gearmand> parameter to C<new>, or undef otherwise.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item $spawner->add_worker(%options)

Add a new worker set to the manager. A new supervisor process will be created
to manage it if one does not already exist for the worker class. Can take the
following parameters:

=over 4

=item * class

(Required) The package name of the L<Gearman::Worker> subclass which will
register itself for work when instantiated. This need not be distinct across
different calls.

=item * source

(Optional) The path to the file containing the definition of 'class'; only
necessary if the module can't be use'd for some reason.

=item * caller_source

(Optional) If true, assume that the source for 'class' is the calling module or
script. This will generally fail if the working directory has changed since
program startup. This overrides I<source> if both are provided.

=item * num_workers

The number of worker children to spawn. If any child processes die they will be
respawned. Defaults to 1.

=item * config

An opaque data structure to pass to the child process, generally used to keep
configuration that is specific to the worker but not any one job. Must be
serializable via Storable.

Submits a task but with less boilerplate than add_task. %options is the same as
for add_task. Marshaling of $arg is done for you in a manner compatible with
methods created with Gearman::WorkerSpawner::BaseWorker::register_method. The
on_fail handler will be called if marshalling fails for some reason.

If the second form is used, an empty %options is created and $callback is used
as the on_complete handler.

Returns the L<Gearman::Client::Async> object used by the spawner.

Loads the given L<Gearman::Worker> subclass, then parses additional arguments
as specified by the return value of the worker class' C<options()> class method
via L<Getopt::Long>. These options are passed to the worker object's
constructor and the C<work> method of the worker object is called repeatedly
until either SIG_INT is received or the ppid changes (parent went away).

This class method is automatically executed if Gearman/WorkerSpawner.pm has no
C<caller()>, i.e. if it is run as a script rather than loaded as a module. This
should only be done by other internal methods of this package (add_worker).

=head1 BUGS

=item * add_worker may sleep in attempt to recontact an unreachable supervisor
process. This is detrimental if a worker is added after the Danga::Socket event
loop is running.
