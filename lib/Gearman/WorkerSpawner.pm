Gearman::WorkerSpawner

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # write your worker code here:

   package MyWorkers::BlahWorker;
   use base 'Gearman::Worker';

   sub new {
       my $class = shift;
       my $slot  = shift; # a numeric identifier for this worker
       my $params = shift; # given below
       my $self = Gearman::Worker->new;
       bless $self, $class;
       $self->register_function(blah => sub { return 42 });
       return $self;
   }

   # and your client code in some Danga::Socket environment, e.g. Perlbal:

   package Perlbal::Plugin::MyPlugin;
   sub register {
       # create one manager per process
       my $worker_manager = Gearman::WorkerSpawner->new(
           gearmand => 'external', # starts a gearmand
       );
       # add different workers
       $worker_manager->add_worker(
           class        => 'MyWorkers::BlahWorker',
           num_workers  => 4,
           worker_args  => {
               foo => 3,
               bar => 1.2,
           }, # passed as second arg to MyGearmanWorker->new()
       );
       $svc->register_hook(
           MyPlugin => proxy_read_request => sub {
               $worker_manager->add_task(Gearman::Task->new(blah => '3.14'));
           }
       );
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Launches subclasses of L<Gearman::Worker> in their own processes for
communication with a gearmand. External Gearman servers may be used, or one can
be created for the lifetime of the spawner.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item * Gearman::WorkerSpawner->new(%params)

Constructor, can take the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * gearmand

Specifies the location of the Gearman server to use. This may either be a comma
separated list of host:port specs, or I<external>, which specifies that the
WorkerSpawner should spawn a separate process to contain a Gearman server. The
advantage of using this over running gearmand externally is that the Gearman
server process will halt itself in the event of the calling process' demise.
Defaults to I<external>.

=back

=item * check_period

Time in seconds between live-worker checks. Any zombie children are reaped with
C<waitpid> during the check, and enough workers are spawned to make the total
C<num_workers> again.

=item * perl

Path to the C<perl(1)> binary with which to execute workers. Defaults to
C<$^X>.

=item * reaper

WorkerSpawner periodically reaps any dead children of its running process. If
there are non-WorkerSpawner child processes in your program, you won't know
when they die. To be notified of that, you can provide a subref as the
C<reaper> parameter which will be called with the PID of any reaped children
which don't belong to WorkerSpawner.

=back

Along that line, only a single WorkerSpawner may be created in a process
(otherwise multiple spawners would race to reap each others' children, making
worker accounting impossible). As such, new() will croak if called more than
once.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item $spawner->add_worker(%options)

Add a new worker set to the manager. A new superviser process will be created
to manage it if one does not already exist for the worker class. Can take the
following parameters:

=over 4

=item * class

(Required) The package name of the L<Gearman::Worker> subclass which will
register itself for work when instantiated. This need not be distinct across
different calls.

=item * source

(Optional) The path to the file containing the definition of 'class'; only
necessary if the module can't be use'd.

=item * num_workers

The number of worker children to spawn. If any child processes die they will be
respawned. Defaults to 1.

=item * worker_args

An opaque data structure to pass to the child process. Must be serializable via
Storable.

Returns the L<Gearman::Client::Async> object used by the spawner.

=item Gearman::WorkerSpawner->_supervise('My::WorkerClass', @ARGV)

Loads the given L<Gearman::Worker> subclass, then parses additional arguments
as specified by the return value of the worker class' C<options()> class method
via L<Getopt::Long>. These options are passed to the worker object's
constructor and the C<work> method of the worker object is called repeatedly
until either SIG_INT is received or the ppid changes (parent went away).

This class method is automatically executed if Gearman/WorkerSpawner.pm has no
C<caller()>, i.e. if it is run as a script rather than loaded as a module. This
should only be done by other internal methods of this package (add_worker).
